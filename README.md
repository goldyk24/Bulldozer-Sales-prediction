# Bulldozer-Sales-prediction
This was project as a competition available on Kaggle. It was published in 2006!. Since I am starting to learn Data Science now, I did it in 2 days and made it to top30 scores of the competition in just one try.
Since this is a prediciton problem, Regression is used to create a ML model and to predict the sales prices of Bulldozer.
Some of the data couldnt be made available on githu since it's size was big, the Necessary links are in the notebook.
